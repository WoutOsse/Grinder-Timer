# Grinder-Timer
Simple Arduino sketch for a grind-on-demand grinder

I copied a LOT of this sketch from other people

This is just my implementation of it, and it works well. Removed a lot of EEPROM statistics etc I didn't need. 
Added start-stop (i think? long time ago) functionality.
Altered the interface (I didn't like press&hold for example)

Still want to add a continuous ('single dose') grind mode.
